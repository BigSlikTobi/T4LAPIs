## Introduction

The Story Similarity Grouping feature extends the existing NFL News Processing Pipeline by implementing intelligent story clustering based on semantic similarity. The system will analyze news stories using embeddings generated from URL context summaries, group similar stories together, and maintain these groupings as new stories are ingested. This enables identification of duplicate coverage, trending story tracking, and comprehensive story evolution analysis.

The feature leverages lightweight LLMs (Google Gemini 2.5 Lite or OpenAI GPT-5-nano) to generate context-aware summaries from URLs, creates embeddings for semantic similarity comparison, and maintains dynamic story groups with proper tagging and lifecycle management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content analyst, I want the system to automatically extract contextual summaries from news URLs using LLM URL context methods, so that I can generate meaningful embeddings for story similarity analysis without crawling or scraping content ourselves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new news URL is processed THEN the system SHALL use LLM URL context capabilities (Gemini 2.5 Lite or GPT-4o-nano) to analyze the URL and generate contextual summaries
2. WHEN using LLM URL context THEN the system SHALL let the LLM handle content access while we only provide the URL and request a summary
3. WHEN extracting context THEN the system SHALL generate a concise, embedding-friendly summary that captures the core story elements (who, what, when, where, why)
4. WHEN LLM URL context fails or is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to using available title and description metadata for summary generation
5. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL normalize entity references (team names, player names) for consistent comparison
6. WHEN processing URLs THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and implement appropriate caching to minimize LLM API costs
7. WHEN context extraction completes THEN the system SHALL store the generated summary alongside the original news item

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the system to generate semantic embeddings from story summaries, so that I can calculate similarity scores between different news stories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a story summary is generated THEN the system SHALL create semantic embeddings using a consistent embedding model
2. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use a model optimized for semantic similarity (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
3. WHEN embeddings are created THEN the system SHALL normalize vectors for consistent similarity calculations
4. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL save them in the database with proper indexing for efficient similarity searches
5. WHEN embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and mark the story for retry processing
6. WHEN embeddings are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version tracking for reproducibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the system to automatically group similar stories based on embedding similarity, so that I can identify duplicate coverage and story clusters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new story is processed THEN the system SHALL calculate similarity scores against existing story embeddings
2. WHEN similarity scores exceed a configurable threshold (e.g., 0.8) THEN the system SHALL add the story to the existing group
3. WHEN no similar stories are found THEN the system SHALL create a new story group with the current story as the initial member
4. WHEN grouping stories THEN the system SHALL use centroid-based clustering to determine group membership
5. WHEN a story group is updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate the group centroid embedding
6. WHEN multiple groups could match THEN the system SHALL assign the story to the group with the highest similarity score

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a news tracking administrator, I want story groups to be properly tagged and managed with lifecycle states, so that I can track new stories and updates to existing coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new story group is created THEN the system SHALL tag it as "new" with creation timestamp
2. WHEN an additional story is added to an existing group THEN the system SHALL tag the group as "updated" with update timestamp
3. WHEN story groups are created THEN the system SHALL assign unique group identifiers for tracking
4. WHEN groups are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of all stories added to the group
5. WHEN tagging groups THEN the system SHALL support custom tags for categorization (breaking news, injury reports, trade rumors, etc.)
6. WHEN group lifecycle changes THEN the system SHALL log all state transitions for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want story similarity data and groupings stored efficiently in the existing Supabase database, so that similarity searches and group management can be performed quickly while leveraging our current infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL extend the existing Supabase schema with dedicated tables for embeddings and proper vector indexing
2. WHEN storing story groups THEN the system SHALL create new tables that reference the existing news_urls table using foreign keys
3. WHEN querying for similar stories THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's vector similarity search capabilities with configurable distance metrics
4. WHEN managing groups THEN the system SHALL support efficient queries for group membership and similarity rankings using existing database patterns
5. WHEN storing group metadata THEN the system SHALL include centroid embeddings, member counts, and lifecycle information in the extended schema
6. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL use the existing error handling and retry mechanisms from the current pipeline

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the story grouping process to be incremental and efficient, so that new stories can be processed without recomputing all existing similarities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new stories are ingested THEN the system SHALL only compute similarities against existing group centroids initially
2. WHEN potential matches are found THEN the system SHALL perform detailed similarity analysis only with candidate groups
3. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL implement parallel processing for embedding generation and similarity calculations
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize processing of high-priority or recent stories
5. WHEN similarity thresholds are updated THEN the system SHALL provide tools to reprocess existing groupings
6. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL implement configurable limits on similarity search scope

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content analyst, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics for story grouping performance, so that I can optimize similarity thresholds and track clustering quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN story grouping runs THEN the system SHALL log processing times, similarity scores, and grouping decisions
2. WHEN groups are formed THEN the system SHALL track group size distribution and similarity score statistics
3. WHEN similarity thresholds are applied THEN the system SHALL monitor false positive and false negative rates
4. WHEN LLM processing occurs THEN the system SHALL track API usage, costs, and response quality metrics
5. WHEN clustering quality changes THEN the system SHALL provide alerts for unusual grouping patterns
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include trending stories, group evolution, and coverage analysis
